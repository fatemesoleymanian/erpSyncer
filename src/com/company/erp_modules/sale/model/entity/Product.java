/** How These Fields Work Together:
 Stock Management: unitsinstock, unitsonorder, and reorderlevel allow you to efficiently manage inventory levels. When unitsinstock falls below the reorderlevel, you place new orders, and the unitsonorder field tracks incoming stock.
 Discontinuation: The discontinued flag ensures that a product no longer available for sale remains in your records, but it wonâ€™t appear in new orders or listings.
 Pricing: unitprice combined with quantityperunit helps customers understand both the per-unit price and how much product they are getting in each unit.
